# NWM DA

This is the software repository for the National Water Model (NWM) Snow Data
Assimilation (DA) Project at the Office of Water Prediction (OWP) in NOAA's
National Weather Service (NWS).

## Description

The purpose of the NWM Snow DA Project is to design and develop a snow DA
capability for the NWM. The primary role of OWP, and the initial focus of this
repository, will be the development of software for processing observations of
snow water equivalent and snow depth collected by ground-based and airborne
observing systems, and for comparing these observations with gridded NWM land
surface states.
